# vim: expandtab ts=2 sw=2 softtabstop=2

# Notes:
# - Most files uses a number as key. The number will be used for sorting and
#   should enable you to empty them out in other pillar .sls files later
# - The ID values used as keys are usually appended to the end of the generated
#   lines as comments, optionally followed by any "comment" key added within
#   that record
# - Valid keys for all the numbered sections should be equal to the header
#   in the generated file, just lowercased
# - I suggest to use series for zones like 100,200,300 etc and keep
#   related rules within those series with a bit of spacing so other ones
#   can be added later.
# - "ipv" keys must be an array!
# - TEST IT FIRST!
#
# This should be considered a bit work in progress, but it seems to work
# fine for me.
